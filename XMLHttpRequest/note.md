## XMLHttpRequest

    🔹 XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers.
    🔹 You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh.
    🔹 This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing.
    🔹 XMLHttpRequest is used heavily in AJAX programming.
    🔹 Despite its name, XMLHttpRequest can be used to retrieve any type of data, not just XML.
